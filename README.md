## ðŸ’¿ Install process
In your terminal execute command to get source code of project

`git@github.com:Radakovic/event_tickets_api.git`

This project uses Docker as working container for running application. To continue with installation you have to have installed

Execution of command will last for long time but only for the first time.
It is because execution of this command has couple stages:
- Pull all required services

- Execute all migrations
- Create fixture data


After completing the installation, your application will run on this port: `http://localhost:8084/`
